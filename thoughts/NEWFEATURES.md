# New Features Plan

## 1. Indefinite Playback
- Modify player to support looping routine indefinitely
- Implement stop mechanism for ongoing playback
- Ensure data transmission and updates without session restart

## 2. Scheduling System
- Create scheduling system for setting intervals (e.g., every 3 hours)
- Implement activation/deactivation for scheduled routines

## 3. Concurrent Execution
- Allow multiple routines to run simultaneously
- Manage resources for stable multi-routine execution

## 4. Data Management
- Implement system to track and update data from ongoing routines
- Ensure data consistency across concurrent runs

## 5. Stop Button Implementation
- Add stop button to routine list view
- Add stop button to routine viewer/player
- Implement backend logic to handle stop requests

## 6. UI Updates
- Update frontend for indefinite playback controls
- Add scheduling interface
- Create dashboard for monitoring multiple concurrent routines

## 7. Testing and Optimization
- Thoroughly test each new feature
- Optimize for performance, especially for concurrent routines
- Ensure compatibility with both local and VPS environments

## Next Steps:
1. Implement indefinite playback in player.py
2. Add stop functionality to backend
3. Update frontend to include stop buttons and indefinite playback option
4. Test and refine the new features
5. Move on to scheduling system implementation
