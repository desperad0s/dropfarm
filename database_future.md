# Supabase Database Approach

This document outlines our approach for database management using Supabase in our project.

## Current Approach
We are using Supabase for both authentication and data storage. This approach allows for quick iteration during the development phase while providing scalability for future growth.

## Handling Schema Changes

When you need to change your data model:

1. Update the corresponding Pydantic model in `models.py`.
2. Use Supabase's dashboard to modify the table structure:
   - Go to the Supabase project dashboard
   - Navigate to the "Table Editor" section
   - Select the table you want to modify
   - Use the interface to add, remove, or modify columns

3. Update any affected routes or tasks to work with the new structure.

## Best Practices

1. Version Control: Keep your Pydantic models in version control to track changes over time.
2. Testing: After making schema changes, thoroughly test all affected API endpoints and functions.
3. Migrations: For significant changes, consider using Supabase migrations to manage schema updates across environments.

## Data Backup

Regularly backup your Supabase data, especially before making significant schema changes:
- Use Supabase's dashboard to create backups
- Consider implementing automated backups for production environments

## Security

Implement Row Level Security (RLS) policies in Supabase to secure your data as you develop.

## Future Considerations

1. As the project grows, monitor performance and consider optimizing queries and indexes.
2. Implement proper error handling for database operations in your application code.
3. Consider implementing a change management process for database schema updates as the project matures.
