# Feature Ideas for Dropfarm

## Current Improvement Ideas

1. Pause and Resume Recording
   - Implement functionality to pause the recording process
   - Allow users to resume recording from where they left off

2. Edit Recorded Actions
   - Create an interface to view and edit recorded actions
   - Allow users to modify, delete, or add new actions to existing recordings

3. Detailed Logging During Playback
   - Implement more comprehensive logging during routine playback
   - Display real-time feedback on the frontend about each action being performed

4. Robust Element Selection
   - Implement multiple locator strategies for element selection
   - Combine CSS selectors with XPath for more reliable element identification
   - Implement fallback mechanisms if primary selection method fails

5. Recording Visualization
   - Create a visual representation of recorded actions
   - Allow users to see a step-by-step breakdown of their recorded routines

6. Error Handling and Recovery
   - Implement more robust error handling during routine playback
   - Add ability for routines to recover from common errors and continue execution

7. Routine Scheduling
   - Allow users to schedule routines to run at specific times or intervals
   - Implement a calendar view for managing scheduled routines

8. Performance Metrics
   - Track and display performance metrics for each routine
   - Show success rates, average completion time, and other relevant statistics

9. Routine Templates
   - Create a library of common routine templates
   - Allow users to quickly start with a pre-defined template and customize it

10. Collaboration Features
    - Implement sharing and collaboration features for routines
    - Allow users to share successful routines with others in the community

## Future Considerations

- Machine Learning Integration: Use ML to optimize routines based on success rates
- Mobile App: Develop a mobile application for monitoring and controlling routines on the go
- API Integration: Allow integration with other services and platforms
- Advanced Reporting: Implement detailed reports and analytics for routine performance
